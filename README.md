- Election Simulator (2020) 
An interactive election simulator showcasing different types of single-winner voting methods visually.Each voter and candidate will be characterized by  a point on a 2-D grid, and the closer a candidate is to a voter,the more likely it is that the voter will vote for that candidate.

- This project uses the votes calculated from the distance as a jumping off point to generate many trials ,each tweaked randomly according to some margin of error to find out the probability of each candidate winning.
-  approval, plurality,two-round and ranked-pair voting.
